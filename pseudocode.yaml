      - play_inning_half_bottom(homeTeam, awayTeam) # Home team is onOffense in the bottom of the inning
      - check_if_game_is_over() # checks scores; if game is tied after 9 innings, play another inning; else, declare the leading team as the winner and end the game
    - if game is not over after 9 innings, continue to next inning

play_inning_half(onOffense, onDefense):
  - initialize_inning() # set outs to 0

GameContextProvider:
  description: The main context provider for the game, managing and providing game state to other components.
  actions:
    - initializeGame(): # Initialize the game state, such as loading teams and players from a database or an API.
    - playInningHalf(onOffense, onDefense): # Play half an inning of the game, managing actions such as at-bats, runs, and outs.
    - checkIfGameIsOver(): # Check if the game is over according to the game rules (e.g., a certain score or number of innings have been reached).
    - incrementOuts(): # Increment the number of outs in the current half-inning.
    - endHalfInning(): # End the current half-inning and prepare for the next one.
    - incrementInningNumber(): # Increment the current inning number.
    - addRunToScore(): # Add a run to the score of the team that is currently up to bat.
    - substitutePlayer(): # Substitute one player for another, possibly with conditions such as the same position.
    - switchRole(): # Switch the roles of the teams (i.e., the team that is up to bat becomes on defense, and vice versa).
    - pitchRoll(): # Perform a "pitch roll" to determine the outcome of a pitch.
    - swingRoll(): # Perform a "swing roll" to determine the outcome of a swing.
    - stealBase(): # Attempt to steal a base, with a success or failure outcome.
    - playAtBat(): # Play an "at bat", which could include multiple pitches and swings, and possibly result in a hit or an out.

  properties:
    - game: # The state of the game, including the score, the inning number, and which team is up to bat.
    - inning: # The state of the current inning, including the number of outs and which half (top or bottom) it is.
    - teams: # The teams playing in the game, including their players and scores.
    - players: # All players in the game, including their stats and current positions.
    - atBat: # The state of the current "at bat", including the batter and pitcher and the number of strikes, balls, and fouls.

  steps:
    - Initialize the game when the component is first rendered using the useEffect hook and the initializeGame() function.
    - Provide the game state and the game action functions to child components using the GameContext.Provider component. The state and functions can then be accessed by child components using the useContext hook with GameContext.

app:
  description: The main application component
  steps:
  - Render the GameProvider to provide access to the game state across the entire application.
  - Use the GameContext to access the game state and game dispatch methods.
  - Set up the game:
    - Prompt the user to enter names for both teams and select which team will be Home and Away.
  - Initialize the draft:
    - Load the player database from ./assets/PlayerDatabase.csv.
    - Display the list of available players.
    - Start the draft with the Away team.
    - Until each team has one player for each required position (C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, LF, CF, RF, DH, P):
      - Prompt the user to select a player for the team that is currently selecting.
      - Remove the selected player from the list of available players.
      - Alternate turns between the teams.
    - Prompt the user to set the lineup order for each team and assign the starting positions.
    - When the user submits the lineups, display both lineups.
  - Start the game by initializing the game state.
  - Display the players for each team.
  - Display the game state using the Game component.
  - Display team information using the Team components.
  - Display player information using the Player components.
  - Display inning information using the Inning component.
  - Use the GameScreen component to render the game on the screen. This component will change depending on the game state (HomeScreen for game initialization, GameScreen for ongoing game).
  - Handle user interactions like player substitution, base stealing, and batting using the AtBat component.
  - Use the useEffect hook to update the game state as the game progresses. This could involve updating the score, inning, outs, and other game-related information.
  - Handle errors and display error messages to the user.
  - Handle game end scenario and display appropriate message to the user.
